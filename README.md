# Sus Goals
  Be Sus , and Save the world...

## What is Sus Goals?
   Sus Goals is simply a project for my Design and Engineering Course under BTech in CSE :<. I was supposed to make a craft based on sustainabilty and design but paper craft sounded soo boring so decided to go with a website and here we are. Why am I telling all these , coz I am out of content to fill this space up
Anyway this site gives you a random Sustainable Goal that refreshes daily,DO IT and click the done button, it will increment the world wide counter for the goals reached. Technical side , Simply a react with next js app with firebase as backend which I coded on a single sleepless night.
