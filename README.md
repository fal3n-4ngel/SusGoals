# Sus Goals
  Be Sus , and Save the world...

## What is Sus Goals?
   Sus Goals serves a noble purpose. Each day, you're presented with a random Sustainable Goal - a reminder of the pressing global challenges we face. By taking actionable steps towards these goals and clicking the 'Done' button, you're not only contributing personally but also adding to the collective effort. Every completed goal increments the global counter, symbolizing the collaborative impact of individuals striving for a more sustainable world.
   
## Why ?
   Sus Goals, an innovative project born out of a Design and Engineering course as part of my pursuit of a BTech degree in Computer Science and Engineering. In this venture, I aimed to fuse sustainability and design into a meaningful endeavor that goes beyond the conventional. While the initial idea was to create a paper craft, I sought to amplify the impact and engagement by transitioning to a dynamic website, and thus, the evolution of Sus Goals began.
